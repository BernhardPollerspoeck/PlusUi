# 9. Hot Reload

**Narration:**

> "Hot Reload. Change your code, see it instantly. No restart needed.
>
> PlusUi hooks into .NET's built-in hot reload system. Run your app with `dotnet watch`, or use the Hot Reload button in Visual Studio or Rider. Change a control, tweak a color, adjust some padding - save the file and watch your UI update in real time.
>
> Your page rebuilds with the new code. Want to see how that new button looks? Save. There it is. Need to adjust the spacing? Save. Done. Trying out different font sizes? Just keep saving.
>
> It's the feedback loop you need when you're designing UIs. No more: change, stop, rebuild, restart, navigate back to where you were, click through three screens to see your change. Just: change, save, see.
>
> It works with your pages, your controls, your user controls. The iteration speed you've always wanted."

**Visual:**

> TODO - Show live code editing with UI updating in real time
