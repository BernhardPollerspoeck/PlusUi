**Narration:**

> "30 controls. But honestly? I'm not gonna list them all. That's boring.
>
> Here's what matters: You can build real apps. Not just 'hello world' demos.
>
> Need a data table? DataGrid. Eleven column types. Editable cells. Sorting. You could build an entire back-office tool with just this one control.
>
> Need a list with ten thousand items? ItemsList. Virtualized. Smooth. Your users won't notice the difference between 100 and 100,000 entries.
>
> Date picker? Built in. Time picker? Built in. Tree view? Built in. No hunting for NuGet packages. No 'this one has 47 GitHub issues but it's the least broken option'.
>
> The boring stuff is covered. Buttons, checkboxes, text fields, layouts - it's all there. The interesting stuff? Also there.
>
> You focus on your app. The controls just work."
