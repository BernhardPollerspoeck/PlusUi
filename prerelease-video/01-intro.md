# 1. Intro

**Visual:** Fluent API code scrolling elegantly in the background

**Narration:**

> "You build an app. It runs on Windows. Great.
>
> Now it needs to run on Mac. And Linux. And in the browser. And on mobile.
>
> You google 'cross-platform UI .NET' and you find... well, you find the usual suspects. The big names. The ones everyone uses.
>
> So you try them. And at first, everything seems fine.
>
> But then you notice your button looks different on Android. Your layout breaks on iOS. That shadow you spent an hour perfecting? Gone on Mac.
>
> You file bug reports. You wait for fixes. You write workarounds for workarounds. You spend more time fighting the framework than building your app.
>
> After years of dealing with the constant issues of the leading .NET cross-platform framework, I started asking myself a different question:
>
> What if consistency wasn't just a goal - but the absolute priority?
>
> What if your UI looked exactly the same on every single platform? Pixel for pixel. No surprises. No platform-specific quirks.
>
> One codebase. 30 controls. 8 platforms. And your UI looks identical everywhere.
>
> This is PlusUi."

**Visual (End):** Logo reveal, beat, transition to Platforms
