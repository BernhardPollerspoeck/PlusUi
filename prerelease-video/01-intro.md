# 1. Intro

## Narration

> "Hi, I'm Bernhard Pollerspöck - independent developer, programming since 1998, working with Xamarin and MAUI for the last 8 years.
>
> Today I'm excited to announce the prerelease of a project I've been building for almost a year: PlusUi - a cross-platform UI framework for .NET.
>
> But before I show you what it can do, let me tell you why I built it.
>
> You build an app. It runs on Windows. Great.
>
> Now it needs to run on Mac. And Linux. And in the browser. And on mobile.
>
> You google 'cross-platform UI .NET' and you find... well, you find the usual suspects. The big names. The ones everyone uses.
>
> So you try them. And at first, everything seems fine.
>
> But then you notice your button looks different on Android. Your layout breaks on iOS. That shadow you spent an hour perfecting? Gone on Mac.
>
> You file bug reports. You wait for fixes. You write workarounds for workarounds. You spend more time fighting the framework than building your app.
>
> After years of workarounds, I decided to try something different.
>
> What if I built it from scratch? My own architecture. No XAML. And the same look and feel - everywhere.
>
> This is PlusUi."
