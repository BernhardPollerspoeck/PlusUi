**Narration:**

> "Let's make things look good.
>
> Solid colors? Obviously. But also linear gradients, radial gradients, multi-stop gradients. That subtle background fade you want? One line.
>
> Shadows. Real shadows with blur and offset. Not some CSS hack that looks different on every browser. Actual drop shadows that look the same everywhere.
>
> Borders. Solid, dashed, dotted. Any color, any thickness.
>
> Corner radius. Round those corners. All of them, or just some - top left and bottom right if that's what you're into.
>
> And everything stacks. Gradient background, shadow, rounded corners, dashed border - all on the same element. Style it once, looks identical on every platform.
>
> Page transitions? Built in. Slide left, slide right, slide up, slide down. Fade in, fade out. Configure the duration, pick an easing function - ease in, ease out, ease in-out. Or set it to instant if you hate fun.
>
> Set a default transition globally, or override it per page. Navigate forward, it slides in. Navigate back, it automatically reverses. Smooth, consistent, no extra code.
>
> And if your user has 'reduce motion' enabled in their system settings? PlusUi respects that too."
