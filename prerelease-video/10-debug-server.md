**Narration:**

> "Okay, this one I'm proud of. The Debug Server.
>
> It's a standalone app. You start it, enable the debug bridge in your PlusUi app, and it connects automatically. And then you see everything.
>
> Live UI tree. Every element, every child, the entire hierarchy - updating in real time. Click on an element and you see all its properties. Background color, padding, font size, whatever. And here's the thing: you can change them. Live. While the app is running. Tweak a color, adjust some padding, see it instantly. No rebuild, no restart.
>
> Properties you use often? Pin them to the top.
>
> Performance monitoring. Four live graphs showing you FPS, frame time, memory usage, and render activity. See exactly where your app is spending time. Measure phase, arrange phase, render phase - all broken down.
>
> Need a screenshot? Take one. The whole page, or just a specific element. Save it to disk or copy to clipboard.
>
> Application logs stream in real time. Filter by level - just show errors, or everything down to trace.
>
> And you can connect multiple apps at once. Each one gets its own tab.
>
> Oh, and the Debug Server itself? Built with PlusUi.
>
> This kind of tooling? Other .NET UI frameworks don't have it. We do. On day one."
