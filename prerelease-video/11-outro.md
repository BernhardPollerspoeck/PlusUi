# 11. Outro

**Narration:**

> "So that's PlusUi. Eight platforms. 30 controls. Type-safe binding. A fluent API that just makes sense.
>
> Now, I should be honest with you. This is a solo project. One developer and his AI tools - it's not 2020 anymore. And yes, building a cross-platform UI framework from scratch is... ambitious.
>
> This is a prerelease. Not version 1.0 yet - but close. A snapshot in time. And I'm sure there are bugs I haven't found yet. Edge cases I haven't considered. Things that could be better.
>
> But here's what I know: the same motivation that got this framework to release will keep pushing it forward. This isn't a side project that'll be abandoned in six months. This is something I believe in.
>
> I'd love your feedback. Try it out, break it, tell me what's missing. If you want to contribute - even better. And if you build something with it? Please let me know. I'd genuinely love to see what you create.
>
> Getting started is simple. Grab the NuGet packages, check out the docs, and start building.
>
> Links are in the description. And if you have questions or just want to chat - join the Discord.
>
> Thanks for watching. Now go build something."
